						<h1>Purpose of the Project</h1>
					</header>
					<p>The purpose of this project is to solve major landslide issues in developing countries. <br />
					The major causes of landslides are slope, water runoff, and deforestation. Attempting to prevent a landslide with <br />
					retaining walls and heavy machinery is too expensive in developing countries. Thus, the most cost effective solution <br />
					will be to plant trees in these high risk areas.</p>
					
<br />
