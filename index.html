<B> Overview </B>

	The purpose of this project is to solve major landslide issues in developing countries.
	The major causes of landslides are slope, water runoff, and deforestation. Attempting to prevent a landslide with
	retaining walls and heavy machinery is too expensive in developing countries. Thus, the most cost effective solution
	will be to plant trees in these high risk areas.
